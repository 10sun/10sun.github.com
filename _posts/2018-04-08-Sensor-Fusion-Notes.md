Title: Sensor Fusion

**Definition**: combining of sensory data or data derived from disparate sources such that the resulting information has less uncertainty than would be possible when these sources were used individually.

**Categories**:
	- *direct fusion*: the fusion of sensor data from a set of heterogeneous or homogeneous sensors, soft sensors, and history values of sensor data.
	- *indirect fusion*: uses information sources like a priori knowledge about the environment and human input.

**Methods and algorithms**:
	- Central limit theorem
	- Kalman filter
	- Bayesian networks
	- Dempster-Shafer
	- Convolutional neural network

**Levels of sensor fusion**:
	- Level 0 – Data alignment
	- Level 1 – Entity assessment (e.g. signal/feature/object). 
		+ Tracking and object detection/recognition/identification
	- Level 2 – Situation assessment
	- Level 3 – Impact assessment
	- Level 4 – Process refinement (i.e. sensor management)
	- Level 5 – User refinement
